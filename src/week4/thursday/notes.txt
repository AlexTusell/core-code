OOP

CLASSES for blueprint logic recreation
INSTANCES for logic execution
OBJECTS for managing data throw logic

CLASS
ATTRIBUTES are the characteristics that will 
define an object, the data that would be stored 
in the object
METHODS are the definition of the behaviour
of the object,what actions can be executed in 
the object

INSTANCE
is the materialization of the object, a type of object that 
belongs to a class

ABSTRACTION
-Using simple things to represent complexity
-Enables the user to implement complex logic on top of the provided 
abstraction without understanding the underlying complexity

ENCAPSULATION
-the properties of the object could be private or invisible to 
others outside the class definition, that way they may not be modified at all,
or be modified through a control. this way we can reuse objects without 
allowing open access to all the data
-this is the prsctice of keeping the properties in private and then provide a
public method to access them

INHERITANCE
-the ability of a class to inherit the properties and actions of another class
-this let us reuse code or to generalize actions and properties

POLYMORPHISM
-two could have the same name for an action but react different depending on
the implementation (method overriding)
-an class could have the same name of an action with different arguments and
different implementation (method overloading)
